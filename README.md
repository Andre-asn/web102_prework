## Notes

Some challenges encountered while building the app:

* **Template Literals and Ternary Operators**: Implementing the dynamic description text with proper grammar (singular vs plural) required careful use of ternary operators to ensure correct formatting.

* **Array Methods**: Working with `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `sort()` methods required understanding how to manipulate arrays without mutating the original data structure.

* **DOM Manipulation**: Managing multiple event listeners and ensuring proper cleanup when filtering/searching games required careful DOM manipulation to avoid duplicate elements.
